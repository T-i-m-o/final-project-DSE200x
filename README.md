# final-project-DSE200x
This is my final project for the course UCSanDiegoX DSE200x "Python for Data Science". The E-Commerce dataset “Ecommerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction” from Kaggle was used to explore if we can use existing customer data to predict if an customer will churn. To explore this classification task the methods Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and K-Fold Cross Validation have been used. The findings show accuracy scores from 0.811 to 0.940. Depending on the model the churn rate can be predicted fairly good. But a deeper dive into the data set is necessary as the origin dataset had a lot of null values and the dependent feature “Churn” is moderate imbalanced. The way the null values and outliers have been handled here had reduced the observations available for the model from 5630 to 2856 (see slide “Data Preparation and Cleaning”). Deeper knowledge is needed, that goes beyond this course and the time available, to use more advanced cleaning techniques to avoid such a huge loss of observations. The feature “Churn” has an moderate imbalanced data with a ratio of 17.75 to 82.25. Here too, deeper knowledge and more time is needed to handle this properly with more advanced techniques - like Downsampling and Upweighting. Please have this in mind!
